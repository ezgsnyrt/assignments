In this assignment, I implemented a basic RESTful API for managing doctor records using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** with **MongoCompass**. Herein, it is aimed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database of doctors.

## Features

1. **Create a Doctor** (`POST /doctors`): Add a new doctor to the database.
2. **Read Doctors** (`GET /doctors`): Retrieve all doctor records.
3. **Update a Doctor** (`PUT /doctors/:id`): Update the details of an existing doctor.
4. **Delete a Doctor** (`DELETE /doctors/:id`): Remove a doctor record from the database.

## Prerequisites

- **MongoDB** (MongoDB v8.0.4 has been used in this project)
